# Competitive programming/algorithms study

This repository contains source code and worked through exercises from
various algorithm books and coding sites. It does ***not*** contain any 
books. All work has been cited where appropriate.

Although all code is written by myself, there will be some similarities to
the examples in books for cases of worked through examples.
